# Boids - simulated flocking of birds

I created a mini-game out of the well known boids simulation concept.

Boids are separated into groups, which under specific conditions can take over boids from other groups.

Apart from the general alignment, avoidance and cohesion behaviors I've implemented additional behaviors, such as player controlled flock movement.
